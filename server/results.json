    "speech": "In this image, you can see a comparison between inflectional and derivational morphology, which are two main types of word modification in language. The diagram illustrates how inflectional morphology changes the grammatical function of a word, such as adding \"-s\" to \"cat\" to make \"cats\", while derivational morphology creates new words by adding affixes, like \"happy\" becoming \"happiness\". This visual representation helps us understand the key differences between these two types of word modification."

    "speech": "In this image, you can see a comparison between stemming and lemmatization, two processes used to reduce words to their base form. The diagram illustrates how stemming can result in non-valid words, whereas lemmatization ensures the output is a valid word, considering the context and part of speech. This distinction is crucial in natural language processing, where accurate word forms are essential for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and machine translation."

    "speech": "In this image, you can see a visual representation of lexical ambiguity, which occurs when a single word has multiple possible meanings. The diagram illustrates how words like \"rose\" can refer to either a flower or a verb, and how words like \"duck\" can be both a noun and a verb, showing the complexity of language and the need for lemmatization to convert words to their meaningful base form. Lemmatization considers the context and part of speech to ensure the output is a valid word, as seen in the examples of words like \"happiness\" and \"dance\"."

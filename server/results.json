    "speech": "In this image, you can see a tree diagram that represents the structure of words and how they are built up from smaller meaningful units called morphemes. The diagram illustrates how morphemes are combined and how changes occur at morpheme boundaries, which is a key concept in computational morphology. This visual representation helps us understand how finite-state transducers work in morphological analysis, mapping root forms to their inflected forms."

    "speech": "In this image, you can see a diagram of a binary tree, which is a type of data structure used to represent a set of elements. The diagram illustrates how the tree is structured, with each node representing a decision point and the branches representing the possible outcomes. This type of structure is often used in computational linguistics to model the ambiguity of language, where a single input can have multiple possible interpretations."

The diagram shows a tree with two branches, one labeled \"simple word\" and the other labeled \"polymorphemic word\", highlighting the complexity of words that are made up of multiple meaningful units. This visual representation helps to clarify the distinction between simple and complex words in linguistics."
